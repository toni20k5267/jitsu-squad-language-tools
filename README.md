# jitsu-squad-language-tools
This is a repository that has tools that make it easier to translate/make custom dialog in Jitsu Squad. This repository will also have all translations/custom dialogs I made.

## What is argument-comparison
This is a tool to check if there is any inconsistency between the arguments. If there is, the wrong part will have red background.
## Why would i need to use argument-comparison
If you translated the file with the help of, for example, ai, as i did to speed up the process(dw, i did check it manually later myself, and improved it), it may have changed the code a little bit, especially the arguments. It did for me, and making the tool took less time than it would to find where the problem is, which did speed up the process by a lot, actually.

## What is code-comparison-no-dialog
This tool is one you would use to check if the code has any inconsistencies between the original file. Just like in argument-comparison, wrong code will light up red.
## Why would i need to use code-comparison-no-dialog
Same reason as for why you would use argument-comparison, but a bit more advanced, in case you are worried about the code being broken, and you can't seem to find the error in argument-comparison

## What is language-file-modifier
This is a tool that allows you to very easily modify the language file, as it sais in the title. This tool also allows the user to add the original language file as a reference. It also allows you to save the file, directly as a .json file for ease. There are toggable buttons, which do **not** get saved between sessions, but i found them useful when wanting to check back on something. If you find them a waste of space, you know you can literally just open any text editor and edit the code, right?
## Why wouldd i need to use language-file-modifier
It is very easy to use, it allows you to save the file you edited(tip: change the name of the file to where you left off so you know what to find next time you load it), and it speeds up the process of translating/checking for translation errors by a **LOT**

# How to use the any of those tools
Simply download the html, open it, and put in the prompted files.
